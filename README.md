# Buzzword bingo in React

My goal is to compare and Elm program to a React one by building the same app.

## Development setup

* Clone repo
* `npm install -g grunt-cli`
* `npm install`

Chrome does not play well with react when displaying files from the file system. Because if this,
you need to run a development server to serve the files via `grunt devserver`.
